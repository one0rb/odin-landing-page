## Introduction

This is my attempt at [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) final project in the Flexbox Chapter of their Foundations Course. We were given a lot of freedom for this one, just a reference image and an image with the relevant colours and font styles, so it should be an interesting project to complete with my budding knowledge of HTML and CSS.

## Aims

There are a few objectives that I'd like to complete over the course of this project:
1. Make the HTML as semantic as possible.
    - While I have a better understanding now of why so many `<div>` wrappers are important for positioning elements on a webpage, I personally think it's confusing and convoluted when you have nothing but `<div>`'s within the HTML, doesn't make it super readable. Instead I'm aiming to use as much of the semantic HTML elements, like `<section>`, baked into HTML already, and use `<div>`s where necessary but with semantic class names as well.
2. Make it responsive, and looking good, with Flexbox at all screen sizes.
    - While I only really know how to position elements with Flexbox at the moment, I've seen enough static websites to know how subpar they look compared to websites that adapt to the sizes they are. It's not enough to simply shrink down appropriately, but should also look good when on a wider screen. There have been too many company websites I've see where it doesn't adapt and only fills half the space available, it just looks like a half-finished product and doesn't leave a good impression.
3. Minimise the number of individual selectors in CSS
    - This is probably just my inexperience in the process, but I found that when comparing my previous solutions in the [css-exercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises) to the *model* solutions, I missed out on a lot of the optimisations and had a few declarations repeating themselves. This time I want to be more aware of this and try to group selectors where I can and try to reduce the filesize of the CSS stylesheet just a little bit.
4. Use git effectively
    - I am going to try and use git as it is suggested to, by recording each *significant* step forward in the process. I might not be as diligent on this as it's a new idea to me, it's not just about saving my work but getting snapshots that I, or others, can refer back to at any given time. There's also the commit message etiquette that I will try to adhere to, that way I can leave behind a git log that is easy for people to look through, and maybe learn from, in the future.
